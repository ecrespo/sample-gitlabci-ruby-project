# Gitlab CI Sample Ruby Project

## Documentation

Simply clone this repository in your Gitlab instance, and make sure to have a Gitlab runner defined (preferably with a docker-based executor) and you'll see your gitlab ci builds working!  This test also demonstrates a new feature in GitLab 3.6 called Dependencies and demonstrates deploy "stages" that launch depending on previous stages.
